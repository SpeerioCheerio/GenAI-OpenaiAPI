I keep changing the API key, apparently the one from last night expired or something. 


1. Configuration & Credentials
At the top, we load your OpenAI API key from an environment variable and define your MySQL connection details—username, password, host, port and database name. This keeps secrets out of the code and lets you swap in new credentials without touching the logic.

2. Embedding the Schema
Rather than pinging the database for schema details each time or pasting the schema into every prompt, we build one large multi-line string (schema_reference) containing your entire classicmodels table definitions. Passing that via LangChain’s custom_table_info ensures the LLM always “knows” which tables exist, what columns they have, and how they relate, without extra network calls or manual repetition.

3. Database Connection
Using the standard SQLAlchemy-style URI plus our embedded schema, we call SQLDatabase.from_uri(...) to get a LangChain-wrapped database object. This object can both introspect your schema (for query planning) and execute SQL once it’s generated.

4. Schema Preview (Optional)
Right after connecting, we print out the detected dialect (“mysql”), the list of tables, and the full schema info. This quick sanity check ensures that your credentials and schema embedding worked correctly before you try to generate or run any queries.

5. LLM & Tool Initialization
We instantiate a ChatOpenAI client pointing at GPT-4o with zero temperature (deterministic responses) and wire it up to two chains: one for translating natural-language questions into SQL, and one for executing that SQL and returning raw results.

6. Natural-Language Rephrasing
Rather than dump raw rows or JSON back at you, we define a PromptTemplate that takes your original question, the generated SQL, and the SQL result, and asks GPT-4o to craft a clear, conversational answer. This happens via LangChain’s StrOutputParser, so it always returns a simple string.

7. Robust SQL Extraction
Because GPT-4o sometimes wraps its SQL in code fences or prefixes like “SQLQuery:”, we include a small extract_sql() helper that strips away any extra text and returns only the valid SQL statement. This guarantees nothing invalid ever gets passed to MySQL.

8. Interactive CLI Loop
Finally, we enter a simple read–eval–print loop:

Read your question from stdin

Generate raw LLM output and display it

Clean & execute the SQL against MySQL

Print the un-processed database result

Rephrase that result into natural language and display it
